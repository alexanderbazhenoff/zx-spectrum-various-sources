## Info viewer

A text info viewer with two-bitplan colours (25fps colour mixing like 
[`gigascreen`](https://speccy.info/Gigascreen), a ZX-Spectrum software screen mode).
[`nfo viewer`](https://zxart.ee/rus/soft/demoscene/nfo-viewer/) was done, but wasn't ever released. I wrote this in
summer 2005, but I totally left the scene in autumn of 2005.  Actually it was planned for games with a lot of info, 
description and magazine articles.
