In the latest years of my demoscenish activity I like to fill a lot of related game infos in dedicated files. One day I 
decided to make a 50fps viewer which could work not only on Pentagon 128 (Russian ZX-Spectrum local clone), but also 
original, +2 and +3 ZX-Spectrum machines with 48 kilobytes of memory. In those days Slider^BIS and Kyv^3mf
sent me some tzx images of Topo Soft games for ZX-Spectrum +2A which can't work on the most ZX-Spectrum clones because 
of specific hardware features (switch RAM pages at #4000 and #8000). So I decided to take one of tzx images and make an
adaptation for ZX-Spectrum 128 machines.

Btw Spanish code was always fun and slow. It was a month or two of re-writing game engine of Livingstone 2A brought me a
pure reverse engineering hardcore times. One day I made a playable beta version with more fast game engine, save/load 
game to memory options, etc. Autumn 2005 I left Speccy demoscene and the adaptation of Livingstone 2B wasn't finish. As
a result it wasn't glued together and 'sunshine cracktro' stayed unreleased.
