## giga screen cracktro concept

About one week in a hospital and walks from there to home in slippers in 2002 brought the next concept of two-bitplan
colours (again my fav 25fps colour mixing) cracktro concept from. Looks nic and a good idea, but unfortunately 
unreleased. Not easy to recall, but there are two sources files and two fonts.
