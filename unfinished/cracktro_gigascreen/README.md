## giga screen cracktro concept

### preamble:

About one week in a hospital and walks from there to home in slippers in 2002 brought another 
demoscenish idea, a concept of two-bitplan colors (again my fav 25fps color mixing) cracktro. That days this peace of 
oldschool was nice and a good idea. I have planned to make page movement from different parts of screens, text rotation,
etc. But due to a lack of time it wasn't released.

### contents:

Not easy to recall, but there are two sources files and two fonts.
